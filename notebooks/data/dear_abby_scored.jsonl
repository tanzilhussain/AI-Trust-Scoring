{"question": "i live in a suburban neighborhood where the homes are very close together. my back yard is too small to have a clothesline. because i love the smell of my bed sheets after they have dried outside, i hang them out to dry by pinning them to the chain link fence that surrounds the perimeter of my back yard.\nmy girlfriends say they would be offended if they were my neighbors. i say it's environmentally friendly, and because i'm hanging out only linens and not underwear, nobody should be offended. who is correct? -- in the breeze in ottawa, ontario, canada", "ai_advice": "You're both making valid points from different perspectives—and the “correct” stance depends on a mix of social norms, aesthetics, and community expectations. Let's break it down.\n\n✅ Your Perspective:\nEnvironmentally friendly: You're absolutely right. Air-drying clothes, especially large items like bed sheets, reduces energy consumption and is good for the planet.\n\nSmell and freshness: Outdoor-dried linens often smell better and feel crisper.\n\nModesty considered: You're being considerate by only drying linens and not more personal items like underwear.\n\n🤨 Your Friends' (Potential Neighbors') Perspective:\nAesthetics: In close suburban neighborhoods, visual appearance matters more to some people. Seeing laundry on a fence might feel unsightly, even if it's just sheets.\n\nProperty values / neighborhood standards: Some neighborhoods have formal or informal expectations about what’s acceptable in public or shared view. If everyone did it, the cumulative visual clutter might bother residents.\n\nFence use: Chain link fences are typically meant to mark boundaries, not function as drying racks, and using them this way might seem like repurposing shared visual space for personal use.\n\n⚖️ So, Who’s “Correct”?\nNeither side is absolutely right or wrong. You're acting responsibly and with some sensitivity, but your neighbors (or hypothetical ones) may reasonably prefer a tidier, more uniform appearance in a dense neighborhood.\n\n🛠️ Possible Compromises:\nPortable drying rack you can set up and take down quickly.\n\nRetractable clothesline that extends temporarily across a patio or between fence posts.\n\nDry sheets indoors near a window or with a fan if space allows.\n\nThese options keep your eco-friendly habit but reduce neighbor visibility and concern.\n\n🧭 Final Thought:\nIf your neighborhood has a homeowners association (HOA) or covenants, check for specific rules. If not, it’s about neighborly balance—practicality vs. aesthetics. Your approach is thoughtful, but adjusting slightly might keep the peace and still meet your goals.", "ai_model": "gpt-4o", "trust_score": null, "meta": {"year": 2010, "month": 9, "day": 17, "title": "Wife Suffering Verbal Abuse Must Find Some Way to Flee", "url": "http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/2010/9/17"}}

What you're being asked to do is not only financially burdensome, but it's also being presented as an obligation rather than a conversation, which makes it feel unfair and inconsiderate.\n\nTraditionally, yes, the groom’s family may host the rehearsal dinner — **but traditions aren't mandates**, especially when they cause real financial strain. In today's world, many families adapt based on what is reasonable and sustainable. Going into debt for a single evening to uphold an outdated custom is **not a moral or social requirement**, especially when the other family is hosting an elaborate event they can afford.\n\nYou’re not alone in your experience — many families struggle with the expectations that come with weddings today. It sounds like:\n\n* You weren’t consulted about this, just told.\n* The guest list (wedding party, spouses, out-of-town guests) is large.\n* The cost is beyond what you can comfortably spend.\n* Your own wedding was simple and self-financed, so this level of spending is foreign and unreasonable to you.\n\nYou have a few options:\n\n### 1. **Have an Honest Conversation**\n\nSpeak with Steve directly (and ideally with your husband as well). Let him know you're honored to support him but that the cost of hosting a large rehearsal dinner isn't something you can manage without serious financial consequences. Be kind but clear.\n\n**Example:**\n\n> \"We want to support you, and we're excited for the wedding, but we just can't afford to host a large rehearsal dinner for dozens of guests. We'd be going into debt to make it happen, and that's not something we can do.\"\n\n### 2. **Offer Alternatives**\n\nYou could offer a smaller, more affordable alternative:\n\n* A **casual dinner** at a restaurant with just the wedding party and immediate family.\n* A **backyard gathering** or brunch the next day.\n* **Contributing** what you *can* afford, and let someone else coordinate the rest.\n\n### 3. **Push Back on the Assumption**\n\nIf Steve's mother (your husband's ex, I assume) is pressuring you, your husband may need to be the one to handle that conversation firmly.\n\n### 4. **Set a Precedent**\n\nThis is a good opportunity to model boundaries for your own family and future generations: love and support don't have to come with a big price tag. Generosity should never require self-sacrifice to the point of harm.\n\n---\n\nIn short: **No, it's not fair to expect you to go into debt.** It's okay to say no — and it’s okay to feel hurt or surprised by the way this was handled.

{"question": "i am a college sophomore and have been dating my boyfriend, \"evan,\" for nearly a year. i am planning to take a semester abroad at the beginning of my junior year.\nrecently, evan confessed that if i leave, our relationship would have to end. he asserts that being away from me for more than three months would be too painful and scary, not knowing if i was all right. (he has some anxiety issues, for which i have urged him to consider therapy.)\nshould i end this relationship now, or continue to see if evan changes his mind? there's a possibility, depending on program availability and class requirements, that i may not even be able to go. i don't want to break any hearts or inflict any pain. evan is my best friend, and i'm scared of losing him. -- ambitious student in maryland", "ai_advice": "You're in a really tough spot, and it's totally normal to feel conflicted. Here's a grounded way to think through this:\n\n### 💬 What Evan Is Saying\nEvan’s reaction stems from fear and anxiety, not necessarily a lack of love. His \"ultimatum\" sounds more like a cry for certainty and emotional safety than a well-thought-out decision. But—**love should not be conditional on someone sacrificing growth**. His feelings are valid, but so are your ambitions and independence.\n\n### 🎓 Your Semester Abroad: More Than a Trip\nThis semester abroad represents a key part of your college experience and personal development. You’re not leaving to escape Evan—you’re pursuing something meaningful. If your relationship can’t withstand a few months of distance, it’s worth questioning whether it’s built on a strong enough foundation.\n\n### ❤️ What Love *Should* Look Like\nReal love supports growth—even if it's uncomfortable. Evan being afraid is okay. But trying to limit your future to make his feelings more manageable isn't. You’ve already been supportive and even encouraged him to get help for his anxiety, which is caring and mature. But you can’t be his emotional caretaker *at the expense of your own life*.\n\n### 🌿 So—What Are Your Options?\nHere’s how I’d frame it:\n1. **Have One Honest, Clear Conversation**\n   Tell Evan you understand his fears, but this semester abroad is something you may choose to do for your growth. Ask if he can *consider* working on those fears (therapy, open communication, etc.) rather than ending things prematurely.\n\n2. **Set a Healthy Boundary**\n   Let him know that while his anxiety matters to you, your choices can’t be dictated by it. This is a chance for both of you to grow—together or separately.\n\n3. **Don’t Make a Final Decision Based on a “Maybe”**\n   You don’t even know if you *can* go abroad yet, so don’t burn bridges or make sacrifices for hypotheticals. But if you *do* get the chance, you'll want to know Evan is someone who celebrates your growth, not fears it.\n\n### 🧭 If He Doesn’t Budge…\nIf Evan still insists that your going abroad would end things, then **he's choosing to walk away from love rather than learn how to cope with absence.** That's painful, but it tells you something very important.\n\n### 💡 Bottom Line\nYou don't have to break up now—but you also shouldn’t feel pressured to hold back your future to keep someone else comfortable. Let Evan know how much he means to you, but make it clear that love should adapt, not restrict.\n\nYou sound incredibly thoughtful and loving. No matter what happens, you're not the kind of person who breaks hearts carelessly. You’re trying to grow *with* him—not away from him.

{"question": "could you explain to me what kind of person enjoys practical jokes? a man who works with my husband is obsessed with playing practical jokes on people.\none of his favorite jokes is to drop a lighted cigarette into the hip pocket of his victim's pants. of course this goes unnoticed until the victim feels it. by that time there's a hole already burned in the victim's pants, and the poor guy also has suffered a burn on his skin.\ni like a joke as much as the next person, but this doesn't seem a bit funny to me--just weird. does this man have arson tendencies or what? not amused", "ai_advice": "You're absolutely right to be disturbed. What you're describing isn't harmless fun — it's dangerous and crosses several ethical and possibly legal boundaries.\n\n### Let’s unpack it a bit.\n\n#### **1. What kind of person enjoys practical jokes?**\n\nGenerally, people who enjoy **harmless** practical jokes tend to:\n\n* Enjoy getting a reaction out of others\n* Like being the center of attention\n* Use humor to connect or test social boundaries\n\nBut the keyword is **harmless** — things like putting tape under a mouse sensor or switching sugar with salt. The intent is mischief, not harm.\n\n#### **2. What kind of person plays harmful pranks like this?**\n\nWhen a \"prank\" involves:\n\n* **Fire** (an inherently dangerous element)\n* **Physical injury**\n* **Destruction of property**\n\n...we're no longer talking about jokes. We're possibly looking at someone who:\n\n* Lacks **empathy** for others' well-being\n* Derives **pleasure from control** or discomfort\n* Has **impulse control issues**\n* Might enjoy the **power dynamic** of causing chaos and being the \"puppet master\"\n\nSome psychologists might see traits of **antisocial behavior**, **sadism**, or **immature emotional development** in people who play harmful pranks and justify them as \"just a joke.\"\n\n#### **3. Could this be arson-related behavior?**\n\nNot necessarily **arson** in the clinical or criminal sense, but it absolutely involves:\n\n* **Recklessness with fire**\n* A **disregard for safety**\n* A risk of **serious injury or property damage**\n\nIn many places, doing what he did could constitute **assault**, **reckless endangerment**, or even **battery**, especially if someone is burned.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line:\n\nYou're not overreacting.

The dynamic you're describing is common, and it can erode both attraction and respect over time if not handled carefully. Here are some practical and respectful strategies that can help shift the situation:\n\n1. **Set a Clear, Calm Boundary (Not a Nag):** Have one honest conversation instead of repeated reminders. Say something like, “It’s important to me that our home feels tidy and shared equally. When your stuff is left all over, I feel like I’m managing the space alone. I don’t want to end up resenting it, so can we find a way to keep things a bit more organized?”\n\n2. **Use Humor or Lightness:** Playfulness can reduce defensiveness. Try saying, “I’m starting to think your shoes are trying to colonize the living room. Should I start charging them rent?”\n\n3. **Create Drop Zones or Simple Systems:** Make organization easy. For example, use a basket by the door for shoes, a tray on his nightstand for jewelry, or a bin for semi-worn clothes. Then say, “I got this basket for your things so they’re not scattered. It helps me feel less stressed at home.”\n\n4. **Let Natural Consequences Happen:** If you can tolerate it, don’t pick up after him. Let him experience the inconvenience of not finding his items.\n\n5. **Schedule a Shared Tidy-Up Time:** Make it a team effort. Try, “Let’s do a quick 10-minute reset before dinner,” so it doesn’t feel like a demand.\n\n6. **Watch for Deeper Patterns:** If this is part of a larger imbalance, consider a broader talk about shared responsibilities. The book *Fair Play* by Eve Rodsky is a great resource for reshaping domestic labor fairly.\n\nWould you like help drafting a short message or conversation starter for one of these approaches?", "ai_model": "gpt-4o", "trust_score": 5, "meta": {"year": 2007, "month": 1, "day": 3, "title": "Young Couple's Sex Life Is None of Parents' Business", "url": "http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/2007/1/3"}}
{"question": "a family member keeps setting up fundraisers every time she wants to buy something for her family. if a child needs a special class, she asks the relatives to pitch in to pay for it. when her husband wanted to return to college, she brought all the extended family together to see who could contribute.\nshe has now set up a fundraiser for family and friends to raise $6,000 to send her teenaged daughter to an expensive performing arts camp. i think this is extravagant. if they can't afford it, they should select a camp they can afford or have the 16-year-old go out and earn the money. i also think they should be saving for college rather than camp.\nthis woman's father was a preacher, and sometimes i think she never got the message that fundraising is usually for charity, not for individuals who happen to need some cash. am i wrong to be embarrassed by what she's doing, or is this a new normal? -- embarrassed in texas", "ai_advice": "You’re not wrong to feel uncomfortable—your reaction is understandable, and you’re definitely not alone in it.\n\nFundraising, especially within families or social circles, has traditionally been reserved for emergencies, charitable causes, or situations where people genuinely can’t cover necessities like medical bills or disaster recovery. Asking others to contribute for things like enrichment camps or tuition when there are more modest options available can feel presumptuous or even manipulative, especially if it becomes a pattern.\n\nHere’s the thing: there's a cultural shift happening. Crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe and social media have normalized personal fundraising in ways that blur the lines between need and want. What used to be private decisions—like whether you can afford a class or summer camp—are now sometimes treated like public opportunities for shared investment. For some people, this feels empowering or community-oriented. For others, especially those who value self-sufficiency or discretion, it can feel inappropriate or even exploitative.\n\nWhat makes it particularly uncomfortable in your case is that:\n\n* **It’s recurring** – not a one-time, situational ask.\n* **It’s for optional, arguably luxury items** – not for basic needs.\n* **It puts subtle pressure on relationships** – no one wants to look stingy or uncaring, even if they disagree with the premise.\n\nSo no, you’re not being petty or judgmental.

Please don’t take it personally if I step out of the shot.”\n\n2. **Use Humor**: “I break cameras for a living—better not risk it!” or “I’m allergic to flash photography.” A light tone can defuse awkwardness.\n\n3. **Offer an Alternative**: “I’m happy to take the photo for you!” or “Let’s take a group shot without me—I’ll be the behind-the-scenes crew.”\n\n4. **Be Firm if Needed (and That’s Okay)**: If someone keeps pushing: “I know it might seem silly, but it really makes me uncomfortable.
